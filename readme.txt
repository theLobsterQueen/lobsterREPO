// KEY //
X: Done
?: "Could" be done.
~: Working on it.

// GOALS //
Sprint 0 (PRE-PRODUCTION) :
	Find the Answers to these Questions :
		[X] How am I going to organize my scene structure?
		[X] How will I render objects to the screen?
		[?] How will I organize my main loop?
		[X] How will I will take and handle input?

Sprint 1 (ENGINE BACKEND FUNDAMENTALS) :
	[X] Handle basic SDL2 input events.
	[X] Render entities onto the screen.
	[X] Create foundations for entity component system.
	[X] Create basic file loaders for GLSL shaders.
	[X] Use uniforms and systems logic to make a scene fully interactable.	
	[~] Build out base components library for more advanced functionalities.
		  (Collision detecting component, lighting component.)
	[ ] Create a fully 3D base shader, complete with (probably Phong) lighting system.
	[ ] Create material component to dictate color.
		  (STRETCH: Make it PBR, adding in details like smoothness/metallicity.)

Sprint 2-Beyond :
	????
	I had stuff for this but, almost as soon as I started developing I realized that the
		engine backend will be a LOT more time consuming than the frontend. So I would
		like to talk to you a little bit about this and create a realisitc set of goals.
